              Our team developed a modular, multi-scenario precision system against CRAB infections, achieving full-process coverage of detection, treatment, monitoring and biosafety control based on its quorum-sensing and biofilm traits. Key innovations include a rapid colonization/infection detection kit, site/stage-specific administration regimens, non-invasive colorimetric visualization, a multi-layered kill-switch system, and an open-source modular toolkit. This system is optimized for cost and usability, targeting vulnerable groups (the elderly, war-zone populations) to support CRAB control under low-sterility conditions, contributing a synthetic biology solution to global AMR and CRAB transmission interruption. We also share all our research resources and the open-source toolkit with the iGEM community to facilitate collaborative exploration and further development of anti-multidrug-resistant bacterial strategies among fellow teams.
